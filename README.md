# Fake-and-True-News-Detection-using-NLP

## Goal
The objective is to build a deep learning model that classifies news article into fake and true news using NLP processes and Gloves embedding.
- Data Cleaning
- Data Processing
- Model Development

In the repository is the notebook where data cleaning was carried out, 

## Result
I managed to build a model made up of LSTM units and archieved 99.7 accuracy on the validation set when provided the article title and body.

## Contained in this repository 
- data_cleaning.ipynb: the notebook where data cleaning was carried out
- completed-fake-true-news: the final notebook where the model was developed
- True.csv, Fake.csv & fake_news_dataset : the data sources
- glove.6B.100d: the glove emdedding file
